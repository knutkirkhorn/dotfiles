# General Coding Practices

## Design and Scope

- Keep changes small and task-focused; avoid unrelated refactors.
- Prefer readable, simple solutions over clever abstractions.

## Code Quality

- Use clear naming for functions, variables, and files.
- Add brief comments only where intent is non-obvious.
- Never end a code comment with a period.
